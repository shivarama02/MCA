        <h1>JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="dis">
        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
            Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

        <h3>STRING FUNCTIONS</h3>
        <p>JavaScript strings are the sequence of characters. They are treated as Primitive data types. In JavaScript, strings are automatically converted to string objects when using string methods on them. This process is called auto-boxing. The following are methods that we can call on strings.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="mathfn">
        <h3>MATH FUNCTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript provides a built-in Math object that contains a variety of useful methods and constants for performing mathematical operations. These functions are static, meaning they are accessed via the Math object itself (e.g., Math.abs()), and they work with numbers, providing essential utilities for both simple and advanced mathematical tasks.
